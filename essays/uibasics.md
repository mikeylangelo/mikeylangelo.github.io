  What I learned...

  For BrowserHistory1 the task was pretty straightforward,taking me three attempts to finish Rx. The first two attempts I had no trouble copying the texts and categorizing them as either h1 or h2. I first had trouble getting the link for the Chrome image to work so I just copied the link address from an image search. Afterwards, the problem was getting the links on the top to jump to a specific part of the page. I looked on the resources on the class website for help. I played around with it before I started my final attempt. I learned that if you wish to assign an id you must put the id before you close it with “>”.  Then assigning the links to the id was easy and finally I was able to finish BrowserHistory1 in time. 
  Personally, I thought that BrowserHistory2 was the easiest of the first three WODs. I had to look on the resources on the class website to learn the correct formatting and values to apply the styles, but afterwards it wasn’t too hard. The only difficulties I had was trying to determine which sections of the page I had to apply the styles to, I was confused whether to apply it to specific sections or the entire body. Applying the fonts were the most frustrating part, so I looked at the demonstration and saw that I had to retrieve the fonts by linking the head to a resource to gain access to other fonts. Overall, it also took me three attempts to finish Rx.
  BrowserHistory3 was definitely the hardest, it took me a long time to figure out how to section off the page. I ended up watching the demonstration for help, which gave me a lot of clarity. I learned that you first must <div> each of the sections and then you can apply formats to them. It took me six attempts and after I finished I was very happy.
  I like the idea of treating the WODs as practice. If you DNF, just try again. To be honest, for BrowserHistory3, I repeated a lot of what was done in the demonstration because I was extremely lost. Although, after taking more then ten attempts at a problem I realize that trying to learn and correct mistakes will be much more beneficial and rewarding than copying without trying.
