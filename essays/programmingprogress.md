My programming skills have definitely improved. I am more comfortable with reading and dealing with HTML and JS, especially if you compare my work with the beginning of the semester. Coding has been very satisfying. I get excited when the code is functioning but I could also be banging the walls when I get stuck, so my enthusiasm for programming can be considered high. When I do get stuck on WODs or assignments it is hard to not look for help or watch the screencast. However, I know that a lot of programming builds on top of each other so I want to understand the logic behind it by eventually completing them myself.  When we complete the labs; I follow along and copy the code but it doesn’t click with me until later. After I review it, the concept is then stuck in my head. I feel like I’m as ready as I can be moving forward; with the only particular struggle I had was syntax. The class was helpful to have some feedback and output with my work. We all had the same stupid questions so I enjoyed how we learn together.
