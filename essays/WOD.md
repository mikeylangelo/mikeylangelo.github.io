The latest WOD I was working with was Invoice 1, which involved creating a sales receipt for various grooming products in a table. For WODs,
I like to complete it without timing myself in the first attempt because I learn the information better. I initially thought that
the assignment was easy since I was comfortable with creating/assigning variables. However, making a table was next (which I thought
was much harder than it actually was). The instructions were hard for me to follow so I figured copying the table from the page source 
was the correct step. String templates were also the bane of my project; there are so many characters and rules I had forgotten!
I felt lost switching between the instructions and my code so I finally checked the screencast.

I used both the screencast and the presentation slides to finish up the WOD. In total it took me six attempts to finish it in prescription
time. Honestly, I do not think I do much to prepare for any of the WODs. I prefer to run right through until problems arise. My approach
is very blunt and it works for me since I'm not usually one to give up. Although, being methodical with my approach also sounds like a
goood idea and wouldn't hurt me. For the next WOD, I will review more of the material before I make an attempt.
