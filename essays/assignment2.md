In this assignment we built on our products page from assignment #1, adding a login and registration page to our products website. The login and registration verify users with valid data so they can proceed to the invoice. I learned from this assignment that you need to have code that works for your project instead of trying to piece together codes each from a separate one. I did not work with a partner but I did have a lot of help from the Professor; he used my assignment as an example in class. I had a lot of trouble with transient data and creating error messages when invalid data was entered. This was easier than assignment #1 since a majority of the work was already done and I felt that the labs were more helpful in regards to saving data. I probably spent 70% of the time thinking about how to do something, 20% on writing code, and the last 10% on testing and debugging. I think the majority of this project turned out well. I did have a small problem with going back and forth between the pages and messing with the quantities. Although, when I finished it all I was very satisfied with my project and I wouldnâ€™t change a thing.
