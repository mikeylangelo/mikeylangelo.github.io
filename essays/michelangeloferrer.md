I moved from California to Hawaii to attend University of Hawaii at Manoa. Life on campus exposed me to many valuable opportunities, which have developed my social and my academic skills. I decided that I wanted to puruse a career in business; I was torn between the different majors, but I eventually settled with MIS. This was influenced by my involvement with Information Technology Management Association, where I learned more about the field and sparked interest in coding and cybersecurity. I am not sure where my career is headed but I believe that learning about MIS is a very valuable knowledge to have, especially with the dependence society is placing on technology.
