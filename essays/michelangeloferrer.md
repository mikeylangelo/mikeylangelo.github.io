I moved from California to Hawaii to attend University of Hawaii at Manoa. Life on campus exposed me to many valuable opportunities, 
which have developed my social and my academic skills. I will graduate in Spring 2021, obtaining my bachelorâ€™s degree in Management 
Information Studies, ultimately leading me to my career.

The classes at the University of Hawaii at Manoa teach me the foundation of being a businessman: applying managerial, financial, 
and organizational concepts practically to reach my goals. I am preparing the tools I would need for life after college.
